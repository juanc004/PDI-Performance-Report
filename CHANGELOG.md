## Extended Description of Code Changes

### Import Statements

#### New Code
- Introduced the `os` library to the import statements. This library could be used for file and directory operations, although it's not utilized in the code yet.
  ```python
  import os
  ```

#### Old Code
- Only the `pandas` library was imported, limiting the code to data manipulation operations.

---

### File Path Specification

#### New Code
- Updated the file path to a more specific location, indicating that the code is potentially ready for a production or semi-production environment.
  ```python
  csv_file_path = '/Users/JuanC/Documents/Developer/Production Scripts/PDI Performance Report/Raw Data/pdit wcn progress check wk2.csv'
  ```

#### Old Code
- Utilized a placeholder file path, suggesting that the code was likely in a development or testing phase.

---

### Data Aggregation

#### New Code
- Improved the data aggregation step by explicitly specifying `numeric_only=True` while calculating the mean. This ensures that the mean is only calculated for numeric columns.
  ```python
  grouped_wcn_df = wcn_df.groupby('About').mean(numeric_only=True).reset_index()
  ```

#### Old Code
- Used a simpler aggregation function that does not specify the `numeric_only` parameter, potentially risking the inclusion of non-numeric columns in the mean calculation.

---

### Team Averages

#### New Code
- Expanded the team average calculation by iterating through each column name, creating new columns in the DataFrame for each team average.
  ```python
  for column in team_averages.index:
      team_column = f'Team {column}'
      sorted_wcn_df[team_column] = team_averages.loc[column]
  ```

#### Old Code
- Calculated team averages but did not specify them in new columns, making it less intuitive to interpret the DataFrame.

---

### Assembling Data for GPSDSU Report

#### New Code
- Introduced a new DataFrame (`gpsdsu_df`) to store specific columns needed for the GPSDSU performance report. This DataFrame is populated with specific metrics and even sorted alphabetically by last names.
  ```python
  gpsdsu_df['About'] = sorted_wcn_df['About']
  gpsdsu_df['UW %'] = sorted_wcn_df['UW Pass %']
  ...
  ```

#### Old Code
- Created a new DataFrame for the GPSDSU report but lacked the specificity and sorting present in the new code.

---

### Exporting to CSV

#### New Code
- Enhanced the code by updating the save path and adding a confirmation message for better user feedback.
  ```python
  save_path = '/Users/JuanC/Documents/Developer/Production Scripts/PDI Performance Report/Report CSVs/gpsdsu_performance_wk2_report.csv'
  print(f"GPSDSU Performance Report has been saved to {save_path}")
  ```

#### Old Code
- Used a placeholder for the save path and provided a generic confirmation message.

---

### Overall

The new version of the code adds several features, including specific data aggregation, more detailed team averages, a specialized DataFrame for the GPSDSU report, and better user feedback during CSV export. It's clear that the new version aims to provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience.
